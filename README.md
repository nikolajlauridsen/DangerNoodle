# DangerNoodle
Snake has lasted through the ages, from DOS in the 70's to Nokia in the late 90'ies to browser flash games where 
it has been resting since then.

Take a step or two backwards in the evolution with me and try my stab at a snake clone.

It's amazingly simple but surprisingly fun. Eat the food, but not yourself.

It might seem overly easy at first, but keep playing and it will soon get very hard.
If you're a total baller and still finding it too easy, then you can simply pop in to the settings 
menu and and ramp up the difficulty

I've included the testers high scores as well as my own in the .exe version of the game, can you beat us?

##Features
* Easy to use .exe for windows users.
* Controls which isn't completely buggy.
* Fully fledged menu system.
* High Score.
* Customizable settings such as start length, start speed and so on.
* Hitting walls moves you to other side of the screen.
* Game overlay displaying score, speed and size.

## System Requirements
Danger noodle is currently locked to a resolution of 1268x766 so a monitor with a resolution higher than that is required
(resolution as a setting is being worked on).

Other than that it's a really tiny game so it should run on pretty much anything (that has more than 50mb of free ram).

The game should work on both Windows, GNU+Linux, and Mac but it's currently not tested on anything other than Windows.

## Installation

2. Extract the zip file (right click and click extract here or use winrar).
